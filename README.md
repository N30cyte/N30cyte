# Howdy there ðŸ¤ ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on all sorts of things but mainly trying to finish up college!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python programming so that I can create my own enumeration tool. I am also looking to learn how to program fun things on the side IE useful tools and games. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with protips that will help me with some programming fundamentals!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my interests.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can hit me up on discord by adding me as a friend. My name on there is `neocyte`
- ðŸ¤– pronouns = "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"
- âš¡ Fun fact: I didnâ€™t hack your system; I just made myself feel at homeâ€”literally `/home/neocyte`
